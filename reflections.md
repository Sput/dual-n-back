1. I went after my first idea for a game. I was able to get it built out in python by importing a library. I then tried to build it out in javascript. I stuggled to get data from the API I was pinging at the rate I needed to in order to make the game work. The workaround I found was to install node and use an API that required a node plugin. Since node is outside the scope of this project I will scrap this project and start over with something simpler. 
2. I need to write up my documentation for my new project and make a first effort at an MVP. First task will be to write up documentation. MY first engineering task will be to get some basic structure built out. Since I am going to attempt a Memory type game, getting blocks on the screen that take some kind of action will be a solid result. A stretch goal for the day is to implement some of the logic in my final product today. 
3. None.
