# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I went after my first idea for a game. I was able to get it built out in python by importing a library. I then tried to build it out in javascript. I stuggled to get data from the API I was pinging at the rate I needed to in order to make the game work. The workaround I found was to install node and use an API that required a node plugin. Since node is outside the scope of this project I will scrap this project and start over with something simpler. 
2. I need to write up my documentation for my new project and make a first effort at an MVP. First task will be to write up documentation. MY first engineering task will be to get some basic structure built out. Since I am going to attempt a Memory type game, getting blocks on the screen that take some kind of action will be a solid result. A stretch goal for the day is to implement some of the logic in my final product today. 
3. None.

1. I was able to get basics of HTML and CSS done in the morning. In the afternoon I started working on javascript. I was able to make some good progress before getting stuck on changing colors of blocks based on random numbers. 
2. I'm going to move random number generator into a seperate function that can be used from different functions. In gnereal this morning I'm going to put everything into it's own function, in order to clean up my code. 
3. Having trouble changing colors of blocks, Paula and Evan gave me some vectors to try to work around it.

1. I got all the functions written, but none connectect to the main execution. Also decided I was getting too fancy with scoring, so I de-scoped a bit, making it more like real Simon. 
2. I need to now wire everything up and make it work as an application. Also implement changes from descoping. 
3. None right now.
