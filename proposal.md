# Proposal of Game
N back is a continuous performance task that is commonly used to test working memory and working memory capacity. 

# Object of the game
The player will be presented with a 3 by 3 grid of blocks. The game operates similar to Simon, but runs continuously. To start the player will select a number of squares "back" they want to remember. The player will need to hit a button when a block in the grid highlights that was highlighted the corresponding number of blocks "back". 

# How to win
The player will continue to click on blocks until one of two conditions are met:
1. The player is able to work through a sequence of 20 blocks without making an error, in which place the game is considered to be "won"
2. The player makes an error. In this case the number of blocks the player was able to memorize will be presented as their "score".
